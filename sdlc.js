// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// don't really know what implementation is

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const requirements = "This is the second step, where you decide what is needed and where this will be deployed, i.e., Windows, Mac, webpage, application, etc."
const design = "This is the third step, where you go into greater detail the needs of the client for the end product."
const testing = "This is the fourth step, code will be written and tests will happen to attempt to break the code keeping it as bug-free as possible while making sure everything is working."
const implementation = "This is the fifth step, I am unsure, but imagine this is when the end product will be delivered to the client and it will get real-world experience."
const maintain = "The final step will be to be kept informed on how everything is working and further debug as problems potentially arise."
